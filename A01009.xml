            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I diſcouer the Falshood, both of your Letter and Counter-ſnarle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Canonicall authoritie of the bookes of Machabees, vvhere the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of praying for ſoules in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie is prayſed. I lay open the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of your Logick by which you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill at our Catholike deduction of Purgatorie from Chriſt his vvordes, in the 12. of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> I shew the vveakenes of your Scripturall aſſault to defeate the perpetuall tradition of the Church, ſtanding in defence of this Doctrine. By the light of miracles, wherewith GOD doth, and ſtill in all ages did illuſtrate his Church, I diſſolue the ſmoky myſts of the Atheiſticall ſcoffs vvhich vampe from your pen. And ſeeing in your <hi>Counter-ſnarle</hi> you will needs <hi>pluck a crow</hi> with me about the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:15523:8"/>
of Chriſtianity amongſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Saxons, therewith I conclude my Letter, shewing that we were from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme conuerted to the Catholick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Purgatorie; yea that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> whome your Myniſters vſe to charge to haue bene the greateſt Patron of this doctrine, was the chiefeſt Author vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der GOD of this our happy purgation from heathenish ſuperſtition. So that this my Letter, deſcribing fiue Victories of Purgatorie ouer your Falshood, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Hereſy, Atheiſme, Idolatry, may be tearmed, <hi>Purgatories Triumph ouer your hell.</hi>

I gaue the poſitiue to your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which I did ſuppoſe was famous, though not being acquainted with your particuler exploites, I could not inlarge my ſelfe in your military praiſes. The comparatiue I did aſſigne to your Pen, which is better knowne vnto me, and ſeeming to deſerue precedence, I termed more famous, praiſing your curious ſtile, which though ouer light for a graue Deuine, I was willing to winke thereat, thinking ſuch a gaudy attire might beſeme a courtly Writer. To your Wit I did reſerue the ſuperlatiue degree, whoſe high pitch, with an alluſion to your name I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vnder the metaphor of a ſoaring Byrd.

The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> is, they ſhalbe puniſhed in this world without pardon, and in the next like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without remiſſiion.

The ancient Fathers expound that place, not that he is indeed ſentenced in this world, but is ſaid to be condemned and iudged, becauſe the cauſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is ſo cleare, that no doubt or queſtion can be made of the ſentence he ſhall receaue<note n="(q)" place="margin">More propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, quia certiſſima eſt no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium damnatio, dicuntur iam iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati. <hi>Aug. apud To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> 27. <hi>in c.</hi> 3. <hi>Ioan</hi>

Your firſt aſſault is by examples: <hi>A Kentiſh Gentlman,</hi> ſay you<note n="(a)" place="margin">Lett. p. <hi>33.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>who not purpoſing to make his heire a great Clark, ſaith, This my eldeſt ſonne ſhall neuer be ſtudent in Oxford or Cambridg: were he not an excellent Arteiſt that ſhould thence inferre,</hi> ergo, <hi>ſome of his ſonnes ſhall

goe to Cambridg? Or if he ſhould ſay, as without ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous abſurditie he may, my ſonne ſhall neither be Scholler in Eaton, or fellow in Kings-colledg, were he not out of his witts, that would here conclude,</hi> ergo, <hi>a man may be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of Kings-colledg, that was neuer Scholler of Eaton, that being againſt the first foundation?</hi> Theſe are your goodly inſtances, by which you would conclude, that the Fathers expounding the wordes of Chriſt as we doe, were out of their witts. Where you doe ſhew your ſelfe ſuch an excellent Arteiſt, that you bring examples that make againſt your purpoſe, as ſhall appeare. For your <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemans ſpeach, that his eldeſt ſonne ſhall not be ſtudent in <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridg,</hi> nor ſcholler in <hi>Eaton,</hi> nor fellow of Kings-colledg, though it do not import, that either his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or third, or fourth Sonne ſhalbe ſtudent in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> or fellow of Kings-colledg: yet this doth follow (except his ſpeach be ridiculouſly abſurd) that ſome youthes may, &amp; vſe to be ſtudents in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> ſome men fellowes of Kings-colledg, elſe it were fooliſh to make that ſpeciall exception againſt his firſt Sonne, which is generall vnto all other mens children.</p>
            <p n="14">14. This will appeare by other examples. Should this Gentleman ſay; My eldeſt ſonne ſhall not be a <hi>Vniuerſitie</hi> ſcholler neither in <hi>Oxford,</hi> nor in <hi>Queene-burrow Caſtle,</hi> were not his ſpeach abſurd? Why I pray you, but becauſe <hi>Quee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-burrow</hi> is no Vniuerſity? Should he ſay, my ſonne ſhall not be ſcholler in <hi>Eaton</hi> nor Pope in Chriſts Colledg, who would not laugh at his ſpeach? The reaſon is, becauſe the fellowes of that Colledg are not Popes. Should he ſay, my ſonne
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15523:50"/>
ſhall not learne his Grammar in <hi>Eaton,</hi> nor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> might not one gather (vnleſſe his ſpeach be ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) that ſome vſe, or may learne their Grammar in <hi>Oxford?</hi> Now to our purpoſe and place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Theſe examples ſhew that except there be ſome remiſſion of ſinnes in the world to come, the ſpeach of Chriſt ſhould be ſenſeleſſe, and abſurd againſt one ſinne, that it ſhall be remitted, neyther in this world nor in the next, except ſome ſinnes may be remitted in the world to come. For he ſhould ſeeme to make, <hi>not remiſsion in the world to come,</hi> a ſpeciall circumſtance of this one ſinne, which were a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall circumſtance of all, and euery one, if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true; by which it is no more, that a ſinne be remitted neyther in this world nor in the next, then meerely not to be forgiuen in this world. So that the particle <hi>nor in the world to come</hi> were idle, without ſenſe, which may not be thought of the world of Wiſdome. Wherefore to make the ſpeach of Chriſt diſcreet and wiſe, we muſt needs graunt, that ſome ſynnes are pardoned in the world to come.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Whence we further inferre, that thoſe ſynnes were not fully and perfectly pardoned in this life. For the ſynnes that were wholy pardoned in this life, need no remiſſion in the next, and if any be remitted in the next, ſuch they are, as were not, at leaſt fully pardoned in this. And this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt being a Scholler in <hi>Eaton,</hi> and a fellow in Chriſts-Colledg, and Remiſſion of ſynne in this world, and Pardon thereof in the next; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be a ſcholler in <hi>Eaton</hi> doth not repugne with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15523:51"/>
being afterward fellow of Chriſts-Colledg; whereas <hi>full Remiſſion of ſynne in this life,</hi> doth not agree <hi>with Remiſſion in the next.</hi> For how ſhall that be truly forgiuen, that is wholy forgiuen before? So that, though one may not inferre he was fellow of Chriſts-Colledg, <hi>ergo</hi> he was not before Scholler in <hi>Eaton,</hi> yet we may and muſt inferre, this ſynne is remitted in the next world, <hi>ergo</hi> the ſame was not formally, fully, and perfectly forgiuen in this preſent life. Thus your owne examples diſcouer your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>thus you are hampered in your owne ſnare.</hi>

Firſt it is not againſt the doctrine of our Church, that ſome ſinnes are forgiuen in the world to come <hi>&amp; quoad Culpam &amp; Poenam, both according to the guilt of ſinne, and according to the guilt of paine,</hi> yea Catholike Deuines commonly teach, that veniall ſinnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the next world according to both guilts, namely <hi>Suarez</hi> in that very place you cited, though of mortall ſinnes he ſaith, that <hi>remiſsio mortalium,</hi> the remiſſion of mortall ſinne in the next world, cannot be vnderſtood, <hi>quoad Culpam, according to the ſinne,</hi> but only <hi>quoad poenam, according to ſome penaltie due to it.</hi>

            <p n="17">17. Secondly your Retortion is of no force againſt that <hi>Poſition,</hi> did we hold it. For out of the former text of Scripture, is gathered clerly, that ſome ſinnes are remitted in the world to come, but what thoſe ſinnes be, <hi>veniall</hi> or <hi>mortall,</hi> likewiſe the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the pardon, whether it be according to the ſinne or penaltie only, or both, cannot hence be proued, but out of other paſſages of Gods word theſe verities are to be ſearched. To make this cleare by your example; Should your Gentleman ſaie, my ſonne ſhall goe to ſchoole either at <hi>Eaton</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> one may inferre, that in eyther of theſe places, ſome kind of learning is taught, but not that Grammar is taught in <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp; Logik in <hi>Eaton,</hi> or <hi>è contra.</hi> Should a young gentleman ſaie, that he will neyther ſtudy in the Innes of Court, nor in the Vniuerſities, one may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, except the ſpeach be ſenſeleſſe, that in both places ſtudies are profeſſed, but he that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that common lawe is ſtudied in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity profeſſed in <hi>London,</hi> were he not abſurd? Soe likewiſe the ſpeach of Chriſt doth only ſignifie in generall Remiſſion in the world to come, not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly explicate the manner thereof, nor the qualitie of the ſinnes that are there purged.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Fayne would you find ſome Paralell in Scripture to this ſpeach of our Sauiour, that may ſeeme no leſſe ſenſeleſſe and idle, then is this ſenſed

The ſpeach you bring out of <hi>S.

            <p n="19">19.

The ſame
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15523:52"/>
may be ſhewed in a thouſand places of Scripture. God the Father ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Sit on my right hand vntill I make thine enemies a foote-ſtoole to thy feet</hi>
               <note n="(g)" place="margin">

So his Mother, that was vntouched vntill ſhe brought him forth, ceaſed not to be a Virgin after her Childbirth. Now noe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple can be brought out of the Scripture, of a ſpeach diſtinctiue, that is, that hath two partes or members, where one of thoſe particles is idle, the ſecond part implying noe more then the firſt.

What thinke you, <hi>Syr Edward,</hi> of this ſpeach? The Virgin neuer committed mortall ſinne from the firſt moment of her life, <hi>vntill</hi> the very laſt thereof; doth this ſpeach ſound vncouthly in a Chriſtian eare?

blaſphemy may not be giuen from God to the Diuel. Thoſe wicked ſpirits do ſeeke in their workes to make themſelues <hi>Mirabiles, non vtiles,</hi> as <hi>S.

Such are Miracles, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall worke, as making the picture of a beaſt ſpeak, bringing downe fire from heauen, faygning himſelf dead and riſing againe. For neither is the Diuel ſo curteous towards mankind, that he will beſtow benefits on their bodies, nor God ſo hard, as to let him entrap their ſoules by ſo ſtrang illuſions as multitudes of ſuch Miraculous helpes and benefits are. Now the Miracles of the <hi>B.
